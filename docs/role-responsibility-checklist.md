# OctoAcme Role-Responsibility Checklist

## Purpose
This checklist helps ensure all critical responsibilities are clearly assigned across team roles for each project phase. Use this to identify gaps, avoid duplication, and maintain accountability.

## How to Use
- Review this checklist at project kickoff and during key transitions
- Mark roles as Primary (P), Secondary (S), Consulted (C), or Informed (I)
- Update as responsibilities shift during the project lifecycle
