## Communication Best Practices

### General Guidelines
- **Be concise**: Respect stakeholders' time with clear, scannable updates
- **Be consistent**: Use templates and maintain regular cadence
- **Be proactive**: Share risks early, don't wait until they become crises
- **Be accessible**: Provide multiple channels for questions and feedback
- **Be inclusive**: Ensure all stakeholder groups receive appropriate updates

### When to Communicate
- **Immediately**: Critical blockers, security issues, major scope changes
- **Weekly**: Regular status updates, progress tracking
- **Per milestone**: Demos, reviews, retrospective summaries
- **On change**: Risk alerts, schedule changes, decision requests

### Communication Channels
- **Email**: Formal updates, broad distribution
- **Slack/Teams**: Quick updates, discussions, real-time collaboration
- **Meetings**: Kickoffs, reviews, decision-making sessions
- **Dashboards**: Self-service metrics and status (always-on visibility)

### Measuring Communication Effectiveness
- Stakeholder satisfaction scores
- Response time to questions/requests
- Number of escalations or surprises
- Meeting attendance and engagement
- Feedback from retrospectives
