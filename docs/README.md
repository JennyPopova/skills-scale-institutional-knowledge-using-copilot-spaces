# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

## Overview

OctoAcme's project management processes are designed for clarity, consistency, and customer-centric delivery. Projects progress through structured phases: Initiation, Planning, Execution, Release, and Retrospective, ensuring business needs are validated, stakeholders are aligned, and work is broken into actionable increments. Key artifacts include one-pagers, prioritized backlogs, risk registers, and retrospectives.

Core personas are Project Managers (schedule, risk, communications), Product Managers (outcomes, prioritization), Developers (implementation, testing), QA/Testing, and Stakeholders. Communication is sustained via weekly syncs, bi-weekly standups, and monthly stakeholder updates. Project boards visualize task progress from Backlog to Done, and escalation protocols resolve blockers swiftly.

Quality assurance is embedded: unit/integration/end-to-end tests, CI pipelines for linting and security, manual QA as needed, and well-documented releases/rollback plans. Risks and dependencies are tracked, with regular reviews and defined escalation paths. Continuous improvement is reinforced through retrospectives, with actionable items and learnings feeding back into process documentation for ongoing evolution.
